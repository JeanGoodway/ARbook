NOTE TO SIR - 
Good day Sir.
I've attached the project in this google drive link. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ow68ir-Nm0hat72M0xC2MwvhI_SqwyED/view?usp=sharing
I wasn't able to build the apk,it kept saying script error.And I could'nt execute the animations because the script did not execute,it says class error.I've left the scripts in the assets.Please help me with that Sir.
Due to all these issues I could'nt submit on time,I had informed you ealier on whatsapp Sir.And I had issues with the installer too but I sort it out.
This poject is not my best ones by far due to so many issues.
It was fun to do,especially working with so many colours and objects.
Thank you so much sir for the videos,they were very detailed and extremely helpful.
I sincerely apologise for my shortcomings with the bugs.
Thank you,have a great day :)
